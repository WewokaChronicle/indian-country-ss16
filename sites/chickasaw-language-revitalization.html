		 <p>The Chickasaw Nation, one of the Five Civilized Tribes, has approximately 50,000 members and covers over 7,600 square miles within 13 counties of south-central Oklahoma (Davis 2016; The Official Site of the Chickasaw Nation 4/16/16). Having been forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands in the southeast after the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Chickasaw suffered a great deal of cultural and linguistic loss. Currently, only about 70 fluent speakers of the Chickasaw language remain (Chew 2014). Seeing the impact this loss has had on its people, the Chickasaw Nation has implemented a number of diverse programs in an attempt to revitalize these ways of life (Francis 2010).

		<h3> History</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Originally settling in parts of Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama, the Chickasaw people were organized into an eleven clan matrilineal system (The Official Site of the Chickasaw Nation 4/16/16). Each clan had a distinct purpose and place in the society. Many of the clans were known for their great warriors and potent medicine-men. The clan system created “a commitment to community, civic responsibility, and devotion to family” that strengthened the individual clans and the society as a whole (Fitzgerald, et al. 2006:13). <br><br> </p>

<p>The Chickasaw people’s first encounter with Europeans occurred in 1540 with a group of Spanish conquistadors. Along with the help of other nearby tribes, the Chickasaw were able to successfully defeat the Spanish and push them out of their lands. As other European settlements began to build up around them, the powerful Chickasaw came to be respectfully recognized by many surrounding settlements. Trade systems were established with the French and the English. The Chickasaw community was actually able to thrive and grow during this time (The Official Site of the Chickasaw Nation 4/16/16). <br><br>

Soon, however, large amounts of Euro-Americans began to settle on Chickasaw lands. After many land concessions, the Chickasaw territory only remained in northern Mississippi. With the passing of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 by the U.S. Congress, Chickasaws, along with many other indigenous communities, were forcibly removed from their homelands and resettled in present-day Oklahoma. This removal affected more than the living situation of the Chickasaw people; their language and cultural practices were disrupted as well. The Euro-American presence in their territory led to an influx of bilingualism within the Chickasaw community. After this point, fewer and fewer Chickasaw parents were teaching their children the traditional Chickasaw language, leading to an overwhelming amount of monolithic English speakers (Davis 2016). <br><br>
 After establishing a Constitution in 1856 which disbanded the clan system and replaced it with a three-branch government much like that of the U.S., the Chickasaw were able to begin to rebuild their community. (The Official Site of the Chickasaw Nation 4/16/16).<br><br>

		<h3> The Chickasaw Language </h3>
		<hr>
		<p>The Chickasaw language, part of the Muskegon language family, is a traditionally oral language. The language was passed from generation to generation in this way until it was decided in the 20th century that, in an attempt to preserve and better be able to teach the language to future generations, a dictionary should be written. In 1973 the A Chickasaw Dictionary was written by Chickasaw Jesse Humes and his wife, Vinnie May Humes. In 1994 Chickasaw: An Analytical Dictionary was written by linguist Pam Munro and Chickasaw Catherine Willmond. Each dictionary uses a unique alphabet, based on the same sounds (The Official Site of the Chickasaw Nation 4/16/16). <br><br>
		Once Euro-Americans began settling in Chickasaw territory, the Chickasaw believed that it would be critical for the Chickasaw people to learn English in order to create strong economic and social relationships with the new settlers (Chew 2015). This led to a large amount of bilingualism among the Chickasaw people. Soon, the Chickasaw began to see their language as damaging to their relationships with Euro-Americans and, for the most part, stopped teaching their children the traditional Chickasaw language (Davis 2016).</p>
