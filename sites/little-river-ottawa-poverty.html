		 <h3>Little River Band and Poverty</h3>
		 <hr><!---->
		 <p>The Little River Band of Ottawa Indians is a Native Sovereign Nation based out of Manistee, Michigan. “The Little River Ottawa descend from members of certain Grand River Ottawa Bands who lived in villages located on the Manistee River, Pere Marquette River, and at several villages on the Grand River system in Michigan.” (Website). Little River is the successor of nine of the original nineteen historic bands of the Grand River Ottawa. The Little River people moved to the western shore of Michigan, and their settlements ranged from the Manistee River in the north, to the Grand River in the south. The Tribe lived there for many years (Website).  The Little River Band had its status terminated in year. However it had its status as a federally recognized Indian tribe reaffirmed and restored by the United States in 1994 (website). Poverty has been an issue in the tribe for a very long time. The Great Depression while hard for all, was especially trying on the Ottawa. “They no longer owned title to any significant amount of land, and the few properties they did hold title to were the crowded home sites of entire extended families, leaving no room for farming beyond planting small garden plots (book.)” The Ottawa had been earning small wages in lumbering and farming but they were lost as jobs became scarce and any available wage labor was given to the Americans over the Indians. In order to survive, the Ottawa continued to live in the traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle, but this became dangerous when the state of Michigan began enforcing game and conservation laws in the territory used for food. The Ottawa could not afford to be arrested and could not pay even the smallest fine. The Ottawa received no aid from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and very little from local and state government (book). Without the traditional knowledge used by the Tribe, they would not have survived. Things got a little better when Franklin D. Roosevelt became president and introduced the New Deal policies. The Wheeler-Howard Indian Reorganization Act in 1934 was put into law and was intended to reverse the policy of assimilation and help strengthen communities. However, congress refused to adequately fund the projects, and attempted to group all Ottawa in Michigan together, causing economic progress to halt. The only option for young Ottawa men was to go away to work in the Civilian Conservation Corps camps, where they worked to repair damage caused by the logging industry. The men planted trees to stop soil erosion, repaired infrastructure, and created many parks (Book). However the Ottawa’s issues would only continue. “The Ottawas’ prospects for creating a new federally recognized, constitutionally guided government and receiving federal assistance under the Indian Reorganization Act died in 1939.(book)” Enos Pego, who had worked tirelessly to establish IRA programs for the Ottawa died, and an extremely destructive investigative report titled “The Holst Report” was published. This reported described the Ottawa culture and way of life as dead, and stated the Ottawa were no different than any other American, and did not need any additional assistance. This report barred the Ottawa from IRA reorganization and from any federal aid. The Ottawa and the Potawatomis to the south were the only tribes in Michigan barred from reorganization (book). World War II brought its own slew of issues. During the war, many Ottawa enlisted in the United States Armed Services. However the women, children and the few men who stayed continued to live in poverty, receive poor educations and still had no federal aid. The largest issues in the Ottawa communities were lack of money, education, and welfare services. The BIA investigated these issues, but couldn’t decide what to do about them. The organization of the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association in 1947 made a large impact on the Ottawa communities. The NMOA was organized into units, with the Little River Band being Unit Seven. The NMOA attained legal counsel and was able to file claims before the Indian Claims Commission. These claims led to the Michigan Ottawas being elgible for financial aid for education, employment, and medical care. The NMOA also gained trust land rights, and fought for the payment for lands ceded.  While the NMOA was not able to gain federal recognition for the Michigan Ottawa as a whole, each tribe pursue recognition separately. Due to a lack of resources, the Little River Band was unable to start the paperwork until much later. In 1991 a grant was given to hire a director, enrollment officer, and secretary. These people worked tirelessly to provide all nevessary documentation, and even travelled to Washington D.C. to speak to Congress. On September 21, 1994 the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians was reaffirmed as a Distinct Federally Recognized Tribe (book). This reaffirmation allowed the tribe access to many new resources and the ability to help its people itself. The Ottawa lived in poverty for many years, and many still do today. However, today the tribe has many programs to help the members get on their feet and further their education. </p>

		 <h3>Programs</h3>
		 <hr><!---->
		 <h4>Elder Programs</h4>
		 <p>Little River provides low income rental housing for elders on tribal grounds. The Elder Chore Services program is in place to help disabled elders keep up on chores around the house and yard. A food program offers elders hot meals three times a day, free of charge. Dependents who reside with the elder are also given free meals. Discounted meals are offered to the tribal community. </p>
		 <br><!---->
		 <h4>Housing Programs</h4>
		 <p>Little River has many programs aimed at easing the costs of buying and maintaining a home. For first time home buyers, the tribe will contribute 10% of their house cost for their down payment up to $12,000. Assistance is available for low income families to be able to pay their electricity bill, as well mortgage assistance. There is a fund that helps with home repair, as well as home budget planning. Two companies provide low cost heating and cooling, and well and septic care for tribal members. There are also a plethora of low income housing available both on and off reservation. While some are reserved for elders, many are available to families. </p>
		 <br><!---->
		 <h4>Education Progams</h4>
		 <p>The Little River Band takes the education of its members seriously and has many programs to aid in higher education. A “Higher Education Scholarship” is offered, which helps to meet unmet need for tribal students attending any nonprofit college or university. A “College Book Stipend” program is also in place which provides members money for books depending on how many credits they take. The stipend ranges from $200 to $500. A “Vocational Educational Assistance” program is offered to students who attend a state agency approved or accredited vocational/technical program, who has unmet need. This program provides up to $4,000 per semester. While the Michigan Indian Tuition Waiver is not a tribal program, the tribe does process the member’s applications for it. The MITW provides free tuition to tribal members at public colleges/universities in Michigan as long as they maintain a 2.0 grade point. The tribe also maintains a “Tutoring Assistance” program which provides up to $500 to help pay for a tutor for elementary and middle school kids who function at least one grade level below the one they are enrolled in. </p>
		 <h4>Student Services</h4>
		 <p>Little River has a special set of programs especially for grade school children from preschool to twelfth grade. These services include school clothing, activities, senior expenses, driver’s training, and a grade incentive program. The school clothing assistance provides $300 each school year for kids to buy new clothes. The activities provides parents with $100 reimbursement to offset the cost of sports, dance, etc. Senior expenses provides graduating members with $425 to pay for senior pictures, announcements, cap and gown, and class ring. Driver’s training assistance is available for one time use and up to $250. The grade inventive program is designed to motivate young tribal members to do their best in school. Students receive a certain amount of money for each perfect grade they receive. </p>
		 <br><!---->
		 <h4>Other Programs</h4>
		 <p>Little River has a program to help encourage tribal members to start their own businesses. The tribe will provide small business loans to members. They also offer Health Services in the form of a Physician, registered Nurse, and a CNA free of charge to enrolled members. Emergency transportation is available to all members. Legal assistance is available. An Attorney is available to give legal advice on many matters, however the attorney can only represent elders in court about matters that do not involve the tribe. The biggest program involved in distribution of wealth is the per-capita distribution. Each tribal member above the age of 18 receives a certain amount of money based on the profit of the tribally owned casino. Each elder receives double the amount of the distribution. Employment opportunities are available at the casino, with preference going to tribal members, as well as positions in the tribal government and natural resources department.</p>
