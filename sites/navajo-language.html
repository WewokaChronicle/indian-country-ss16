      <h3>Language Revitalization</h3>
	  <h4>Evan Karlson</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>As you read this sentence, are you actually giving thought to what language with which you are deciphering the words you read? 
		 Most likely, you have not. Language, the ancient construction with which humans made society among other things, 
		 a powerful weapon of survival is an instrument of immense value. English next to Spanish, is the national language of government and business. 
		 Yet, according the U.S. Census Bureau there are over 169 existing Native American Languages in the United States.<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bureau of Census, 2011. <em> Native North American Languages Spoken at Home in the U.S.: 2006-10 : American Community Survey Brief Reports</em>">  
		 The Navajo rank first amongst languages spoken with a speaker base of around 350,000 speakers.<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bureau of Census, 2011. <em> Native North American Languages Spoken at Home in the U.S.: 2006-10 : American Community Survey Brief Reports</em>">  
		 This figure may seem minute, however this number is equivalent to the entire population of the nation of Belize.<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Population” <em>The World Bank Total Population</em>">  
		 The fight for the survival of the Navajo language entails a substantial history that spans multiple centuries of colonization, cultural targeting, and revival. 
		 Survival and revitalization of the Navajo Language and its flourishing, entails a story that offers hope for the survival of all Native Languages.</p>

		 <h3>The Origins of Catalouged Navajo<h3> 
		 <hr>
		 Navajo has been spoken for thousands of years, however the historical beginnings of the struggle for preservation can be traced to the passage of the Congressional Passage of the “Civilization Fund” in 1819.<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Lockard, Louise. 1995. New Paper Words: Historical Images of Navajo Language Literacy. <em>American Indian Quarterly</em>">  
		 This fund passed in the name of instilling “habits of civilization” enveloped a greater drive for English language enforcement however simultaneously called for the cataloguing of Native Languages. <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Louise, Lockhard">
		 In the case of the Navajo language, a Captain for the United States Army by the name of Captain J.H. Eaton was ordered to translate a list of over 450 Navajo words.  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Louise, Lockhard">
		 The efforts of Captain Eaton were the first in modern recorded history in which any attempt had been introduced to record, catalogue, and preserve Navajo. 
		 Naturally, the efforts to catalogue Navajo were not performed with the intentions of the tribe, however this process has allowed in retrospect to ensure the future survival of Navajo. 
		 Between 1863 and 1884 during the period of forced relocation to reservations, mission schools served as the only instrument of language preservation. 
		 In particular, the Navajo mission school at Fort Sumner, New Mexico served through its multiple handlers, an attempt to Christianize the Navajo but one in which the missionaries actively sought to learn the language of the sinners they attempted to save. <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Louise, Lockhard">  
		 The first Navajo dictionary was compiled by Chee Dodge (First Tribal Chairman of the Navajo) and Washington Matthew’s (Fort Defiance Post Surgeon) in the late 1890’s.  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Louise, Lockhard">
         The efforts to catalogue Navajo reached their zenith under John Collier’s tenure as Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs between 1933 and 1945. 
		 Collier set forth motions to establish programs in bilingual education, adult basic education, Indian teacher training, and in-service education.  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Louise, Lockhard">
		 Although once again the overarching reasoning for Collier’s Measures lay in English language education, an equally great president was placed on cataloguing and preserving native languages. 
		 The efforts of Colliers, Chee Dodge, and others establish the historical insight necessary to comprehend the modern issues surrounding Navajo.
